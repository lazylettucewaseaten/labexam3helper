Description (What we did)-

In this assignment, we built a syntax analyzer using Lex and Yacc.

First, we defined the tokens in our '12340370_12340340.l' file. This file is responsible for scanning the input text and converting it into a stream of tokens that our parser can understand.
Next, in our '12340370_12340340.y'. A crucial part of this was setting the operator precedence and associativity. This ensures that expressions like 'a + b * c' are parsed correctly, with multiplication having a higher precedence than addition.

During coding, we encountered some shift/reduce conflicts. 
We resolved these conflicts by carefully examining the grammar and the states generated by Yacc with the help of '-Wcounterexamples'.
In most cases, we were able to resolve them by restructuring the grammar or by explicitly specifying the precedence and associativity of the operators involved in the conflict , The dangling if else problem was solved using nonassoc and prec.
Earlier extern int was used for debugging.

Compilation:
lex 12340370_12340340.l
yacc -d 12340370_12340340.y
gcc -o 12340370_12340340 lex.yy.c y.tab.c

Usage:
